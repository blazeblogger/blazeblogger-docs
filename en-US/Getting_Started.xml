    <title>Creating a New Blog</title>
    <para>
      To create a new blog, move into the directory in which you want to keep its working copy, and type the following at a shell prompt:
    </para>
    <screen>~]$ <command>blaze-init</command>
Created a BlazeBlogger repository in .blaze.</screen>
    <para>
      This will create a hidden directory, <filename class="directory">.blaze/</filename>, in which the blog data will be stored. The actual content of this directory is not important, and it is recommended that you never touch the files in it directly. To recover its content should it ever be damaged, use the same command again:
    </para>
    <screen>~]$ <command>blaze-init</command>
Recovered a BlazeBlogger repository in .blaze.</screen>
    <para>
      You can also revert the existing configuration, theme, and language files to their initial state by supplying the <option>--force</option> (or <option>-f</option> for short) command line option:
    </para>
    <screen>~]$ <command>blaze-init -f</command>
Recovered a BlazeBlogger repository in .blaze.</screen>
    <para>
      For a complete list of available command line options, refer to <xref linkend="sect-Core_Utilities-init" />.
